# yul-be-a-better-solidity-developer

This repo contains all the code presented in the 'Yul be a solidity developer' tutorial.
The series is aimed at solidity developers that are considering trying out Yul and don't know where to start or for people that maybe have some experience but are stuck on some topics.

This is a personal project.
